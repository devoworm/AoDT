### Differentiation Map Description

1) differentiation maps attempt to capture the "phase angle of cell division" between the trajectory of the two daughter cells that result from a differentiation event.  

2) this requires us to establish the position of all cells by estimating the center of mass of each cell. This might be done through the use of GFP marker expressed in the nucleus or the centroid of a Voronoi model.

3) the phase angle is calculated in a field that represents the two anatomical dimensions that explain the most positional variance. In an embryo, these are most likely to be the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis and the left-right (L-R) axis. These two dimensions represent analtomical asymmetry and segmentation, respectively.
