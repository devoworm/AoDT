## Quick description:

1. overlapping patterns that move against one another, or one pattern displaced with respect to the other.

2. patterns such as concentric circles (number of objects increases linearly, size scaling factor is exponential) or nested polygons (number of objects increases linearly, size scaling factor is asymptotic).

3. output of a Triangular State Machine (TSM): [link to repo](https://github.com/devoworm/Triangular-State-Machines-TSM)


Moire patterns (Wikipedia): [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern)

* can we create a GRN to create this output?

* can we create another type of self-organized brain to perceive this output and process the information within? See [this grant proposal](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Proposals/blob/master/Physical%20Intelligence%20and%20Emergence%20mini-grant/Abstract.md)

Compare with Turing morphogenesis, differentiation tree model.

* in Turing morphogenesis, stripes or patterned modules are produced through gradient formation.

* gradients vs. no gradients (or controlled) pattern expression.

* motifs (grating), motifs are expressed in space and can overlap. Offset determines complex pattern formation.

* another version of positional information (relative movement). Create a coordinate system for overlapping patterns and their interaction information.

Examples that involve static linear gratings [link](https://github.com/devoworm/AoDT/tree/master/Moire%20Patterns%20for%20Developmental%20Data/Gratings) and concentric circles [link](https://github.com/devoworm/AoDT/tree/master/Moire%20Patterns%20for%20Developmental%20Data/Overlapping%20Concentric%20Circles) in various stages of separability and overlap. 

* what degree of overlap produces meta-patterns? what shapes are best for observing Moire patterrs (concentric circles but not bars)?

Genetic Algorithm/Artificial Life model:

* gratings produced by expression of segmentation genes (_Hox_-like modules).

* new gratings produced by rotation, mutation, recombination, and substitution.

* overlap between two gratings (array of elements) produces interference patterns, which can do computations as they move and implement regulatory functions such as lateral inhibition.

* can also implement gradients and gradient boundaries.

* also contains perceptual information such as visual and haptic illusions.
