## Quick description:

1. overlapping patterns that move against one another.

2. patterns such as concentric circles (number of objects increases linearly, size scaling factor is exponential) or nested polygons (number of objects increases linearly, size scaling factor is asymptotic).

3. output of a Triangular State Machine (TSM): [link to repo](https://github.com/devoworm/Triangular-State-Machines-TSM)
