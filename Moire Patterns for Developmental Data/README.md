## Quick description:

1. overlapping patterns that move against one another, or one pattern displaced with respect to the other.

2. patterns such as concentric circles (number of objects increases linearly, size scaling factor is exponential) or nested polygons (number of objects increases linearly, size scaling factor is asymptotic).

3. output of a Triangular State Machine (TSM): [link to repo](https://github.com/devoworm/Triangular-State-Machines-TSM)


Moire patterns (Wikipedia): [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern)

* can we create a GRN to create this output?

* compare with Turing morphogenesis, differentiation tree model.

* in Turing morphogenesis, stripes or patterned modules are produced through gradient formation.

* gradients vs. no gradients (or controlled) pattern expression.

* motifs (grating), motifs are expressed in space and can overlap. Offset determines complex pattern formation.
