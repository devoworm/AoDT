## Quick description:

1. overlapping patterns that move against one another, or one pattern displaced with respect to the other.

2. patterns such as concentric circles (number of objects increases linearly, size scaling factor is exponential) or nested polygons (number of objects increases linearly, size scaling factor is asymptotic).

3. output of a Triangular State Machine (TSM): [link to repo](https://github.com/devoworm/Triangular-State-Machines-TSM)

* can we create a GRN to create this output?

* compare with Turing morphogenesis, differentiation tree model.

* in Turing morphogenesis, stripes or patterned modules are produced through gradient formation.

* gradients vs. no gradients (or controlled) pattern expression.

* motifs (grating), motifs are expressed in space and can overlap. Offset determines complex pattern formation.

* another version of positional information.


Genetic Algorithm/Artificial Life model:

* gratings produced by expression of segmentation genes (_Hox_-like modules).

* new gratings produced by rotation, mutation, recombination, and substitution.

* overlap between two gratings (array of elements) produces interference patterns, which can do computations as they move and implement regulatory functions such as lateral inhibition.

* can also implement gradients and gradient boundaries.

* also contains perceptual information such as visual and haptic illusions.
