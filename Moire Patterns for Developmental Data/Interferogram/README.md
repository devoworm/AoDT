Interferograms:

* show waveforms A and B, in addition to the additive interference between A and B.

* when A and B are in-phase: constructive interference. A + B results in a wave of greater amplitude.

* when A and B are 180 degrees out-of-phase: destructive interference. A + B results in a wave of lesser amplitude.
