Interferograms:

* show waveforms A and B, in addition to the additive interference between A and B.

* when A and B are in-phase: constructive interference. A + B results in a wave of greater amplitude.

* when A and B are 180 degrees out-of-phase: destructive interference. A + B results in a wave of lesser amplitude.

Measure distance between edges (stripes, concentric circles). measure aperture of the overlap 

Aperture: diameter of overlap/diameter of diffusion pattern. Consider overlap between two morphogen source diffusions:

* strongly overlapping (short distance between sources): 0.9/1.0 = 0.9 (large aperture).

* weakly overlapping (long distance between sources): 0.05/1.0 (small aperture).
