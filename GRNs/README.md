Regulation:  

1) control of flows and fluxes, particulrly temporal flow.

2) regulate tempo of development and other processes.

3) control of "state", multiple elements.

4) multiple sets of interactions that create profiles.

5) origins in the work of [Waddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._H._Waddington), [Davidson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_H._Davidson).

Stochastic generation:  

1) Gillespie algorithm, kinetics, Petri nets, flux balance analysis.

2) genes can encode bits by being _on_, _off_, or _intermediate_ states.

3) internal structure of state can also amplify or suppress noise through feedback.

4) Boolean model simplifies mapping of biological function to a phase space.

5) heterochrony can be observed in artificial regulatory networks.

Models used to approximate GRNs:

1) network parts lists.

2) topological models.

3) network control logic models (Boolean).

4) dynamic models.

5) finite state linear models (combination of Boolean and continuous models).

Use Random Boolean Networks (RBNs).

1) population of cells with identical GRNs.

2) GRNs exhibit criticality when regulatory links are changed between pairs of genes.

3) leads to asymmetric morphologies.

Connectionist architectures can also be used to model GRNs. Chapter 4 of "Ingenious Genes: How Gene Regulation Networks Evolve to Control Development" by Roger Samson (MIT Press).

* addresses issue of evolvability.

* information processing and regulatory systems (how does boolean networks act on target given environmental variation).
