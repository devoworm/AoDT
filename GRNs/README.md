Regulation:

1) control of flows and fluxes, particulrly temporal flow.

2) regulate tempo of development and other processes.

3) control of "state", multiple elements.

4) multiple sets of interactions that create profiles.

5) origins in the work of Waddington, Davidson.


Stochastic generation:

1) Gillespie algorithm, kinetics, Petri nets, flux balance analysis.

2) genes can encode bits by being _on_, _off_, or _intermediate_ states.

3) internal structure of state can also amplify or suppress noise through feedback.

4) Boolean model simplifies mapping of biological function to a phase space.

5) heterochrony can be observed in artificial regulatory networks.

Models used to approximate GRNs:

1) network parts lists.

2) topological models.

3) network control logic models (Boolean).

4) dynamic models.

5) finite state linear models (combination of Boolean and continuous models).
