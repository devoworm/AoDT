Additive and multiplicative models are GRNs that account for adidtive and multiplicative effects across multiple genes (GxG) and between genes and environment (GxE).

Gene-gene (GxG) interactions: GxG is the measurement of interactions between multiple genes in a network. Such interactions can be additive (linear) or multiplicative (nonlinear). Additive interactions can be characterized by stochiometry, while multiplicative interactions are characterized by enhancer control.

Gene-environment (GxE) interactions:
